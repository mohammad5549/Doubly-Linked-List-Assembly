# Doubly-Linked-List-Assembly
Doubly Linked List program in C++, MIPS Assembly, and optimized Compiler Generated Code

This project is divided into two main stages, where I’ll work on linked list operations in both MIPS assembly and Intel x86-64 assembly language. Initially, I’ll focus on converting and optimizing a MIPS assembly program involving a singly linked list, then expand it to a doubly linked list with enhanced functionality. In the second stage, I’ll transition to a Linux environment, using a doubly linked list implementation in C++ to analyze and improve compiler-generated x86-64 assembly code.

The MIPS assembly code implements a doubly linked list. Each major function and its corresponding code snippet are explained with respect to memory management, control flow, and register usage.
